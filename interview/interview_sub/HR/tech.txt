Round 2: It was a pen paper based round. All the candidates were given the same question i.g 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/move-zeroes-end-array/ which we have to code on paper within 45 minutes with all possible approaches
i.g starting right from brute force to the most optimised one. Around 50 applicants were shortlisted for next round.
Tips- The code should must be neat and clean with proper indentations. If you are left with enough time then you can also
add comments to it. Besides this, never forget to mention time and space complexities.

///what we can see here that we must tell them every approach here,not just run over the optimised version.
